An alternative to this action are:


# [changed-files](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/changed-files)

This is mature solution with many contributors and users.  I'd say idea for small projects.

My solution is designed to work as the last step in a workflow, this one could work as part of workflow, and you could run other steps after it.

changed-files is easier to setup, you don't need config files on disc.

Many things are supported, like submodules.
The only thing in my solution is better is a helper script that allows to detect which files are not covered.
